# Mini Issue Tracker (Frontend + Backend)

## Requirements

### Problem Statement

Build a Mini Issue Tracker where users can create, update, and view issues in a dashboard. This is a full-stack task using a React + Django with GraphQL stack, incorporating an AI-powered feature using LangChain and Google Gemini for enhancing issue descriptions. You're free to use any AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, ChatGPT) to assist your work.

## Functional Requirements

### Backend (Django with GraphQL)

‚Ä¢ **User Authentication:** Implement JWT-based or session-based authentication.

‚Ä¢ **GraphQL APIs for:**
  ‚óã **Issues:** CRUD operations for issues (fields: title, description, status (OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, CLOSED)).
  ‚óã **Optional:** Support for tags or priority fields.
  ‚óã Query to fetch issues assigned to a user.
  ‚óã Mutation to invite a team member to the board.

‚Ä¢ **Permissions:** Users can only edit/delete their own issues.

‚Ä¢ **AI Feature:** Integrate LangChain with Google Gemini to enhance issue descriptions. When a user submits a rough description, the Gemini model refines it into a clear, professional format before saving.

### Frontend (React with GraphQL)

‚Ä¢ **Login Page:** Simple authentication interface.

‚Ä¢ **Issue Dashboard:** Display issues with status badges (OPEN, IN_PROGRESS, CLOSED).

‚Ä¢ **Create/Edit Issue Modal or Page:** Form to create or update issues, including AI-enhanced description processing.

‚Ä¢ **Filters:** Filter issues by status.

‚Ä¢ **Invite Team Member:** Interface to invite a team member to the board.

‚Ä¢ **Real-Time Updates:** Use WebSocket (e.g., via Graphene-Django subscriptions) or polling for real-time issue updates.

‚Ä¢ **Drag-and-Drop Status Update:** Allow users to drag issues between status columns (e.g., Kanban-style board).

## Optional Extras (Nice-to-Have)

‚Ä¢ **Markdown support** for issue descriptions (post-AI enhancement).

## AI Tools Requirement

You must use at least one AI-based tool in your workflow, in addition to the mandatory LangChain + Google Gemini integration for enhancing issue descriptions. Examples of additional AI tool usage:

‚Ä¢ **Cursor:** Generate boilerplate code or React components.

‚Ä¢ **Copilot:** Assist with form handling, GraphQL schema generation, or Django models.

‚Ä¢ **ChatGPT/Codeium:** Generate README, test cases, or code optimizations.

## Submission Guidelines

‚Ä¢ **GitHub Repository:** Create a public GitHub repository.

‚Ä¢ **README.md:**
  ‚óã Project setup instructions (backend and frontend separately).
  ‚óã GraphQL APIs used (queries, mutations, subscriptions).
  ‚óã Tooling used (explicitly mention AI tools and their purposes, including LangChain + Google Gemini for description enhancement).
  ‚óã Known limitations.

‚Ä¢ **Loom Video Demo (2‚Äì3 mins, strongly preferred):**
  ‚óã Walkthrough of the app (login, issue creation, AI-enhanced description, drag-and-drop, etc.).
  ‚óã Highlight which parts were assisted by AI tools (including LangChain + Google Gemini).

‚Ä¢ **Sample .env.example:** Include if environment variables are needed (e.g., for Google Gemini API keys, Django settings, etc.).

‚Ä¢ **AI Tool Clarification:** Specify which AI tools were used and for what purpose (e.g., "Used Cursor for React component scaffolding, Copilot for GraphQL schema, LangChain + Google Gemini for description enhancement").

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Expectation

Aim to complete the project within **3 days of focused effort**.
